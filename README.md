To run your todo app locally you should install Docker, it should be supplied with Docker compose, if not, please install it separately.

Then, using the terminal, navigate with cd command to the downloaded folder and simply run:

```
docker compose up
```
Add -d flag to run it detached.

To stop the container you should execute following command from the same folder:

```
docker compose down
```

To change the default creds for app and database, please simply change the respective env variables in the docker-compose.yml file.
